# Parameter Optimization Grid - Entry Parameters Focus
# Target: Improve signal generation during Election Rally period (Nov 6 - Dec 6, 2024)
# Problem: Current strategy (RSI_THRESHOLD=60, SIGNAL_CONFIRMATION_BARS) too restrictive

# Fast SMA: Test responsiveness to trends
# Current: 30. Test range for earlier detection
fast_sma = [20, 25, 30, 35, 40]

# Slow SMA: Trend confirmation filter
# Current: 100. Test range around current value
slow_sma = [80, 100, 120, 150]

# RSI Threshold: CRITICAL PARAMETER - Lower to allow more entries
# Current: 60.0 (too high). Test 50-60 range for moderate trends
rsi_threshold = [50.0, 52.0, 55.0, 57.0, 60.0]

# Trend Divergence: How strict on trend alignment?
# Current: 0.002. Test relaxing this filter
trend_divergence_threshold = [0.001, 0.002, 0.005]

# Trailing Stop ATR Multiplier: Keep aggressive settings
# Current: 3.5. This seems reasonable, test range
trailing_stop_atr_multiplier = [3.0, 3.5, 4.0]

# Order Cooldown: Current 60s seems fine
# Test slightly longer to prevent overtrading
order_cooldown_seconds = [60, 120]

# Total combinations: 5 * 4 * 5 * 3 * 3 * 2 = 1,800 tests
# Estimated time: ~30-60 minutes depending on API rate limits
